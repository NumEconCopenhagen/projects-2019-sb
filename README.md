**Data project**
In our data project we investigated the performances of football coaches in the World Cup from 1930 to 2014. By calculating the win-ratio of every coach, we conclude that Joachim Loew has been the most succesfull coach in the World Cup history with a win-ratio of 83%. 

**Model project**
Our model project is an analysis of the Solow model with natural ressources. We find the steady state values numerically and analyse how the different parameters affect the economy. 

**Exam project**
The exam project contains our answers to the three exam problems. 

**In addition, our repository contains links to the feedback we have given.**
