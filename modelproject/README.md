# Modelproject

The model considered in this project is a Solow model with a fixed natural ressource, X, which could be interpreted as land. The aim of the project is to describe the effect of the amount of land on the economy through numerical simulation of the model and visualizations. We illustrate the positive effects of savings and technological growth as well as the negative effect of population growth on the economy. Finally, we illustrate the diminishing returns to scale on land in the economy.
